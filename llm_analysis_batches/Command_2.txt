# Analysis of Command Design Pattern Implementations

Please analyze the following implementations of the Command design pattern across different projects.

For each implementation:
1. Evaluate how well it follows the design pattern principles
2. Identify strengths and weaknesses
3. Suggest refactoring opportunities
4. Rate the implementation on a scale of 1-10

## Overall Analysis

Based on these 5 implementations of the Command pattern:

1. What are common implementation approaches?
2. What are the best practices demonstrated?
3. What are common pitfalls or anti-patterns?
4. What would an ideal implementation look like?
5. Provide a generic refactored example that addresses the common issues.
