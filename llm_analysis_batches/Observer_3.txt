# Analysis of Observer Design Pattern Implementations

Please analyze the following implementations of the Observer design pattern across different projects.

For each implementation:
1. Evaluate how well it follows the design pattern principles
2. Identify strengths and weaknesses
3. Suggest refactoring opportunities
4. Rate the implementation on a scale of 1-10

## Implementation 1: Observer in 11 - PMD v1.8 (ID: 137)

### Class Structure:
- **observer**: net.sourceforge.pmd.ReportListener
- **concreteObserver**: test.net.sourceforge.pmd.ReportTest, test.net.sourceforge.pmd.rules.design.UseSingletonRuleTest
- **concreteSubject**: net.sourceforge.pmd.Report

### Developer Comments:
Il nous manque la classe qui joue le role de subject!

## Implementation 2: Observer in 13 - Software architecture design patterns in Java (ID: 157)

### Class Structure:
- **subject**: src.OBSERVER.MonthlyReport
- **concreteSubject**: src.OBSERVER.ReportManager, src.OBSERVER.SupervisorView
- **observer**: src.OBSERVER.Observer
- **concreteObserver**: src.OBSERVER.YTDChart

## Overall Analysis

Based on these 2 implementations of the Observer pattern:

1. What are common implementation approaches?
2. What are the best practices demonstrated?
3. What are common pitfalls or anti-patterns?
4. What would an ideal implementation look like?
5. Provide a generic refactored example that addresses the common issues.
