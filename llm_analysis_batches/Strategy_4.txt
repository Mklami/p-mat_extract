# Analysis of Strategy Design Pattern Implementations

Please analyze the following implementations of the Strategy design pattern across different projects.

For each implementation:
1. Evaluate how well it follows the design pattern principles
2. Identify strengths and weaknesses
3. Suggest refactoring opportunities
4. Rate the implementation on a scale of 1-10

## Implementation 1: Strategy in 18 - DrJava v20040326 (ID: 2071)
